If you capture your data as form object, then you will likely have two layers of validations.

Second layer of validation might be further down in your service layer where you already have the form object constructed with correct types, but their values might not be valid per your application requirement.

All these are good (assuming the framework is a good quality one), but keep in mind that majority of cases when there is a problem occur, it's mostly at the framework specific layer, or even more likely your own code that use the framwork.

If you are a beginner, I strongly encourage you to study the Servlet API and see how form is handled, this gives you a more solid understanding of how the data come about in a web application. If you look further into the Java EE stack, it actually already has a framework that's called JSF as part of EE 6 standards. It's design is to help construct web pages as components model; and it lets you capture form data and automatically bind to a bean object in a much more smoother and integrated fashion. JSF is worthy of its own topic for future posts.")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=n.exports}}]);
