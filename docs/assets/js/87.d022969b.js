Well to be fair JRebel is much more advance and richer in support your Java classes reloading, however for purpose of web dev, Tapestry seems to provide a sweet spot and boot productivity  tremendously.)")]),e._v(" "),r("p",[e._v("I was intrigued enough to continue reading the rest of their documentation for advance usage and architecture design.
