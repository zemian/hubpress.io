So what happen if these are not want you wanted, and you need special scheduling pattern? You can certainly write and extend the timemachine.scheduler.Schedule class and provide all the needed methods. But writing such Schedule implementation is much harder. Not only you would need to fully understand the base class, you would also need to deal with the persistence side in the DataStore; saving and re-load the states of your new Schedule implementation.
