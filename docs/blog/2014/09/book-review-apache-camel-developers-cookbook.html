		<h1>Book Review: Apache Camel Developer&apos;s Cookbook</h1>

	<p><p>I got a chance to review the &quot;<a href="https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/apache-camel-developers-cookbook">Apache CamelDeveloper's Cookbook</a>&quot; by Cranton and Korab. Overall I think this is a<br />
great book. System integration problems and solutions come in many forms, so<br />
getting started by reading on some proven solution recipes is definitely a good<br />
way to improve your skill. This book provides more than 100 examples on how to<br />
solve integration problems with Camel framework; from simple standalone Java<br />
application to testing, transaction, monitoring and even a chapter on web<br />
services. Each example comes with brief explanations and further reading<br />
references. My favorites are the side notes sprinkled throughout each recipe.<br />
Clearly these great tips can only have came from well experienced Camel<br />
developers who has spent time on the field.</p>
<p>As many cookbook style, the book can only go to certain length with each example<br />
on explanation and teaching, but readers may dig much deeper by using the<br />
sample code provided by this book. In fact I think it's really cool that it's available<br />
through GitHub as well. Check it out at <a href="http://github.com/CamelCookbook/camel-cookbook-examples">http://github.com/CamelCookbook/camel-cookbook-examples</a>.<br />
(although I think there is a typo in the book for this URL on the copy I have!<br />
^_^) The sample code are complete, clean and easy to follow for each recipe<br />
example. The source code is in Maven based project, so you will get all the<br />
dependencies needed by just running the &quot;install&quot; phase. Open by any<br />
major IDE and you will start reading and compiling immediately. Because it's<br />
using Maven, you can also download the Camel dependencies with Source, and you<br />
can jump right into the framework code itself to analyze what's behind this<br />
cool project.</p>
<p>Because it's a cookbook, it does not go into too deep about Camel internal. But<br />
through the examples, many of the core concepts of Camel has been touched; and<br />
it serves as a great example and can be used as handy reference book. Because<br />
it covers the Camel concept briefly, it expected you to know little bit of the<br />
integration knowledge and background though. Things like Enterprise Integration<br />
Patterns and transport technologies used such as File, FTP, SEDA, JMS etc. The<br />
book also comes with many Spring based XML configuration examples, and it<br />
expects you to know some basic knowledge of bean configuration. But the xml<br />
configuration of Camel routes itself are very self explanatory, so readers should able to follow along easily.</p>
<p>If you work with Camel project, or have to start an integration project, I<br />
would recommend you to check out this book.</p>
