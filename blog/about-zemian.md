Hi there, 

My name is Zemian Deng, and this is my programming blog. My interests are developing software and sharing knowledge. The first programming language I learned is `C` back in 1995. Today, I use `Java` as my primary programming language, but I also enjoy using other scripting such as `Python` and `Bash`. I like to be pragmatic when it comes to software design. I think simple code makes less buggy software.

I use this blog as my personal journal to record tips and notes on what I have learned. Feel free to leave a comment below if you share the same interests. You will also find more about me through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zemian-deng-profile) profile and Open Source project contributions at my [GitHub](https://github.com/zemian/) account.
