I wrote a simple notes taking web application called [FirePage](https://github.com/zemian/firepage). It's a single `index.php` page application for managing Markdown notes. Try it out and let me know what you think!

It can also be a simple file based CMS publishing web application.

Here are few screenshots on how it looks like:

NOTE: I originally named it MarkNotes, but later found out that there is already an application with same name exists. So I renamed to FirePage to be more unique.
