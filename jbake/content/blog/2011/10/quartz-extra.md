Looking for some extra goodies for Quartz Scheduler? Check out [myschedule-2.2.0 release](http://code.google.com/p/myschedule/downloads/list)!

Besides some small update to the web UI for quartz management, this release comes with a standalone quartz-extra jar you may download. See what it can do in [QuartzExtraUserGuide](http://code.google.com/p/myschedule/wiki/QuartzExtraUserGuide).
