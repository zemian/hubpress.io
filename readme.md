This repository contains files for https://zemian.github.io/ site.

The site is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages) service. The `docs` is a special folder as [source folder](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site) that served as root for the site.

The folder `docs` is generated by a Static Site Generator powered by [vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/). The data for the generator is in `blog` folder.

## How to write a new post

## How to build it

## Todo

* How to exclude folder from build?
* Can I add images in the `_posts` directory?
* Add next/prev link on blog Post?
* Add RSS to blog?
* Add user comments (disqus or simply GitHub issues) to blog?
* Add vuepress-plugin-container support to blog?
* Can we disable server side SSR generation step during build?
* Does a build always need to update so many files in output directory?
