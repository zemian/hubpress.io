This usage is very common and the Application class is been used as a global space holder in your application. Starting with EE 6, there is a new spec API introduced called CDI (context dependency injection) that can replace this kind of direct service lookup in your application. The CDI is a Java objects container (services in our case), or sometimes\ncalled "beans container" that automatically manged the objects life\ncycles for you; and then it can "inject" into places where you need\nthem. Using CDI to manage your services can make your Servlet easier to test, and less code to maintain since you don\'t have to write and maintain the Application class.')]),e._v(" "),n("p",[e._v("Let's see how we can turn our previous example to use CDI.")]),e._v(" "),n("p",[e._v("First step is to remove the Application class have have, and to use injection of UserService instead.
